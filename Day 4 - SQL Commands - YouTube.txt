Day 4 - Foreign Key Constraint, Check Constraint, DDL Commands (Create, Alter, Drop and Truncate)

Create a Department table with the names of all the departments in the company -
create table department(
dept_name varchar(30) primary key,
dept_head varchar(30)
);

Insert data into the departments table - 
insert into department (dept_name,dept_head) values ('IT','Ravi Kiran'),('Finance',null),('HR','Swati Rao');

Create a table employee-
create table employee(
id serial primary key,
f_nm varchar(20) not null,
l_nm varchar(20) not null,
age int not null,
location varchar(20) not null default 'Hyderabad',
dept varchar(20) not null
);

Insert some values into it - 
insert into employee (f_nm,l_nm,age,dept) values ('mohan','bhargav',30,'IT'),('manoj','bajpai',35,'HR'),('Rani','Kumari',40,'Finance');

Insert more records into employee with new departments -
insert into employee (f_nm,l_nm,age,dept) values ('priya','darshini',30,'HealthCare');

Add the foreign key contraint - 
alter table employee add foreign key(dept) references department(dept_name);
This will fail as we already have a record with Health Care.

Let's delete that record.
delete from employee where dept = 'HealthCare';

Now add the constraint - 
alter table employee add foreign key(dept) references department(dept_name);

Now try inserting a record with a deparment name that is not in the department table - 
insert into employee (f_nm,l_nm,age,dept) values ('priya','darshini',30,'HealthCare');

insert into employee (f_nm,l_nm,age,dept) values ('priya','darshini',30,'IT');

Now let's try to delete a department from the department table - 
delete from department where dept_name = 'HR'; 

This is not allowed due to the foreign key constraint. 

Suppose, there is no data in employee table with that department, then what would happen -
delete from employee where dept = 'HR';

Now, the (delete from department where dept_name = "HR";) statement will work.

CHECK Constraint:

create table school (
name varchar, 
schoolname varchar default '360digitmg', 
age int, 
check (age>= 10));

insert into school (name, age) values ('Ram',10), ('Ravi',20);
select * from school;
insert into school (name,age)  values ('Priya',8); ----new row for relation "school" violates check constraint "school_age_check"

Eg 2:
CREATE TABLE products ( product_no integer, name text, price numeric CHECK (price > 0) );
insert into products values(1,'apples',100.00),(2,'oranges',200.00);
select * from products;
insert into products values(3,'grapes',-100.00),(4,'plums',200.00);  ---- 	new row for relation "products" violates check constraint "products_price_check"
insert into products values(3,'grapes',150.00),(4,'plums',200.00);

DDL - Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate

Alter Statement-

To Add a Column: ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name datatype;
alter table student add column location varchar(30) not null default 'Hyderabad';

To Drop a Column: ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
alter table student drop column location;

To Change the Data Type or Size or the DataType: ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name TYPE datatype;
alter table student alter column first_name type varchar(50);

To Rename a Column:ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_column_name;
alter table student rename column location to emp_location;

Drop - deletes the entire table along with the structure
Truncate - Drops the table and recreates the structure. We can't give "Where" clause.
Delete - Deletes the Rows/Tuples in the table, we can give "Where" clause and delete exactly what needs to be deleted.
